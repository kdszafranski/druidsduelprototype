# A Druid's Duel Prototype

This code represents the complete JavaScript-based prototype of the turn-based strategy game A Druid's Duel. It implements all game rules and allows up to four players to play a complete game on the same machine.

# Project Status

The codebase was completed in August 2013 and does not currently run due to modern cross-origin script limitations. It contains only client-side code and the map files are loaded synchronously from the file system. The entire game was meant to be run locally only. This issue (and possibly others) need to be resolved before the game will run.

# Credits

All programming and artwork by Kris Szafranski. The basic architecture is based on code from Jacob Seidelin's book, HTML5 Games: Creating Fun with HTML5, CSS3, and WebGL.

SFX contain some copyrighted material though it has been altered.

The music was composed by Troy Strand and reflects the final original score.

# The Code

The game is implemented in JavaScript and uses the Sizzle, jQuery, and Modernizr libraries. The code is based on the underlying loading and board/input engine described in Jacob Seidelin's book: HTML5 Games: Creating Fun with HTML5, CSS3, and WebGL (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119975085.html)
